# 🎛️ Q-SYS / Lua Code Samples

This repository contains selected examples of my work developing control logic, plugins, and UI components within **Q-SYS** environments. These samples are provided to demonstrate my coding style, problem-solving approach, and experience designing maintainable system control logic.

---

## 📌 Overview

The examples in this repository highlight:

- **Lua-based control scripting** for Q-SYS Cores  
- **Dynamic routing & state-management logic**
- **Custom UI component behavior for touch panels**
- **Integration with external networked AV devices**
- **Readable, maintainable, and modular code practices**

Each project folder contains:

- Source `.lua` files  
- Supporting UI/config files (when applicable)  
- Inline comments explaining logic flow and design decisions

## 🧭 How to Review

You can open these directly in **Q-SYS Designer** to browse the scripts.

Open UI projects using VScode.  (dont forget to run "npm i")

If you'd like a guided walkthrough, I’d be happy to explain key functions and architectural reasoning during the interview discussion.
